ABSTRACT

Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in the retail industry, as accurate sales predictions enable businesses to optimize inventory management, supply chain operations, and resource allocation. Retail sales data often exhibit multiple seasonal patterns, such as daily, weekly, and annual cycles, which can be challenging to capture using traditional forecasting models. This research aims to explore the effectiveness of ensemble methods in improving the accuracy of time series forecasts by combining the strengths of multiple models to capture various seasonal patterns and other complexities in retail sales data.
